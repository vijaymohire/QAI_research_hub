# QAI_research_hub
The QAI research hub is a Center of Excellence that offers our research work done for various domains and problems using QAI technologies and related conten and code as relevant. 

Research Topics mainly focused on use of QAI and related technologies for the upgrdation, migration of legacy classical systems and processes to a newer QAI platform that can offer better quality of results in terms of computational speed, less energy used, able to solve and optimize complex algorithms, operations and real world use cases.
